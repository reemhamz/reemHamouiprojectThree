# reemHamouiprojectThree

This is my third project at Juno College in Toronto. Its premise was focusing on building an interactive project using JavaScript.
I opted to create a website with a genre between a quiz and a game. I wanted to create something more than just a quiz, but somethig that the user really feels like they are interacting with.

I came up with an idea of having the user feeling like they are entering a Starbucks cafe and interacting with a barista. 

Though it doesn't have much gamification concepts, the user can at least feel, even just for a slight moment, that they are a customer in this virtual cafe!
